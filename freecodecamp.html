						Introduction
					</h2>

					<p>
						The FreeCodeCamp Visual Web Design Certificate consists of 5
						projects, each with set requirements expressed as User Stories. For
						each project, you’re given a project concept and a set of
						requirements to fulfil, alongside a snippet of JavaScript to test if
						you’ve met all of the constraints. Once you’re done with each
						project, you submit it to FreeCodeCamp, and after completing all 5,
						a certificate is generated in your name — hosted on the FreeCodeCamp
						site in perpetuity.
					</p>

					<p>
						Completing and submitting these projects was a pretty great
						experience — it gave me a chance to build 5 different websites with
						defined constraints, practice my coding skills and most importantly,
						design 5 different websites. Each page has a distinct brand
						identity, layout and overall design purpose. For someone looking to
						transition into digital Product Design, this seemed like a great
						chance to stretch my skills and ship some projects that had some
						practical goals, rather than fake concepts in my design files.
					</p>

					<p>
						In total, I built 5 projects. For each project, I fulfilled the
						FreeCodeCamp constraints — while adding my own goals on top of that.
						This case study will talk about those constraints, my overall goals,
						and the outcomes for each project.
					</p>

					<p>
						In general, building these pages was a great experience. While these
						aren't Products with a capital P (with users, customers or business
						models), I did my best to treat them as realistically as possible.
						Throughout these projects, I got great exposure designing to user
						stories, managing compromises, and the experience of what actually
						deploying live websites is like.

						5 Biggest Lessons:
					</h2>
					<p>
						Throughout these 5 websites, the lessons I learnt included design,
						coding, writing, project management and just general planning. The
						most important lessons I want to focus on are all orientated around
						design, especially related to current industry trends.
					</p>

					<p>
						Although I haven’t worked in the technology industry, I follow the
						tech/design scene closely. That mostly looks like a lot of time
						spent on Twitter, podcasts and blog posts. Because of that, I know a
						considerable focus in design right now (2019) is big (and growing)
						investments in design systems. From what I’ve seen, that shift helps
						people move their focus away from designing individual boxes in
						Sketch/Figma/Photoshop/XD to freeing up time for solving real
						customer, people and business problems. This quote, by Jina,
						courtesy of XYZ, really helps frame this shift.
					</p>

					<p>
						With design systems in mine; these 5 projects gave me a deep
						appreciation for the benefits, purpose and need for design systems.
						Looking at my summarised lessons, there are specific themes of
						structure, planning, consistency, and functionality. I think these
						ideas closely mirror the benefits design systems provide and for
						nothing else these are some great lessons to learn. I’m super
						excited to dive into design systems in the future and keep learning
						from industry experts paving the way!
					</p>
					<!-- <ol class="cs-article__summary-ol" start="1"> -->
					<ol class="cs-article__table-of-contents-ol" start="1">
						<li>
							Set the project up for success from the start. That means
							<strong>always using</strong> responsive and fluid design
							principles, establishing base grid systems early, and using
							system-design for colours, layout and typography.
						</li>
						<li>
							The most
							<strong>important product is the final deployed design</strong>,
							having a cool idea in a design tool loses its shine if it makes
							the product more difficult to use or not functional.
						</li>
						<li>
							Organise everything in a usable, clear way. This helps you keep
							working on and adding additional design functionality as you
							progress.
						</li>
						<li>
							With each different 'brand identity', each project has similar
							base foundations, especially in Typography, Layout and Spacing.
						</li>
						<li>
							Use a step by step process by starting with core functionality,
							then adding additional styles, layout and structure at each step.
							Think about the core goal of the product, build that function,
							then add on from there with <strong>required extensions</strong>.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						These lessons came up to varying degrees throughout each project —
						and will definitely help me in making more consistent and enjoyable
						product experiences in the future.

						Applying a Consistent Design Process
					</h2>
					<p>
						Each of the 5 projects followed a consistent design process — and
						one that slightly differed from my usual method. With more typical
						design problems, I would explore potential solutions, do extensive
						research, ask questions about the problem we’re solving and identify
						key stakeholders to consult work alongside before committing
						directly to a solution.
					</p>

					<p>
						For these projects — the solution (a website) was defined, and this
						was more experience in design delivery than exploration. Within that
						context, every project was kicked off by looking at the required
						user stories and building from that point onwards. This process
						ensured the required user stories were completed — and helped
						structure the extended user experiences around the necessary
						functionality, rather than building beautiful presentation layers
						and adding functionality in backwards. This basics first approach
						was definitely useful, and mirror similar MVP style product
						development approaches.

					<h2 class="text__supporting-title--style cs-article__text--heading">
						Goals and Overall Approach
					</h2>
					<p>
						Within each goal, I had some direction provided by the technical
						constraints of FreeCodeCamp, and then I had my own goals for each
						project — which focused on usability and user experience.
					</p>

					<p>
						Within each project, the majority of the FreeCodeCamp requirements
						were technically completed (as judged by FreeCodeCamp) with HTML
						markup, and very minimal styles via CSS. This resulted in barebones
						pages — missing opinionated typography, clear hierarchy or apparent
						structure.
					</p>

					<p>
						That barebones presentation wasn’t quite the desirable, visually
						appealing functional solutions I was aiming for as I treated these
						as serious ‘fake’ projects. Because of that, I made sure that once
						each test was passed, I kept refining and iterating on each project
						to build desirable, approachable user experiences layered on top of
						that foundational functional layer.

						Defining Design Constraints
					</h2>
					<p>
						Counterbalancing the technical goals provided by FreeCodeCamp — each
						project had a few additional constraints that I held myself too.
						These can most easily be explained as either A) Design Best
						Practices or B) Pushing myself out of my comfort zone.
					</p>
					<h3 class="cs-text__article--h3 ">Design Constraints:</h3>
					<ul class="ul-skills-and-services">
						<li>
							Fully responsive and fluid layouts for any potential screensizes.
						</li>
						<li>
							Semantic HTML5 whenever possible to maintain accessibility and
							keep websites as modern as possible.
						</li>
						<li>
							A focus on only HTML5 and CSS with limited to no JavaScript or
							other build tools. This helped ensure speed and perfomance.
						</li>
						<li>
							A unique brand identity for every page, ensuring every page has a
							different style, personality and layout structure.
						</li>
						<li>
							Original copywriting for every page, reflecting that copy and
							product writing is an essential part of user experience.
						</li>

					</p>
					<p>
						This project focuses on a dynamic grid-based layout, with the
						alternating images and text pattern creating visual hierarchy and
						interest.
					</p>
					<p>
						To remain responsive, the images fluidly respond to browser size
						changes — at a certain point shrinking to fit in a small screen
						view.
					</p>
					<p>
						The image, title and text component used here is duplicated
						throughout each innovators description, with CSS being used to
						manipulate position. This reduced duplication and ensured the same
						components could be used throughout.

						For future similar projects, I would explore ways to generate each

						as dynamic ordering or user-submitted content while ensuring a
						consistent display approach.

					<p>
						Web forms are notorious for being tricky to work with, style and
						design. For this project, I focused on doing the basics well. Using
						modern HTML5, I was able to clearly lay out each form section,
						attach clear labels to each question, and add small affordances to
						help the user progress through the form.
					</p>
					<p>
						The topographic background (courtesy of

						Further styling of the checkboxes and radio buttons could

					</p>
					<p>
						Landing page design has a very tried and true history. Styles have
						trended in and out of fashion, with the current trend illustration
						focused. The FreeCodeCamp project required a video, which provided
						the core media element for the top of the page.
					</p>

					<p>
						To introduce variety, I experimented with bold borders and a
						semi-chaotic grid for the favourite recipes section. This created a
						bit of a broken grid feel while retaining an underlying orderly grid
						that everything is structured around.
					</p>

					<p>
						Overall, this project needs a bit more work to be genuinely polished
						— I think in part showing the gap between my initial ‘concept’, and
						the final design I actually delivered. Good experience in continuing

					<p>
						Re-visit the sizing, layout and margins between different elements.
						The initial concept was to have overlapping features, however, while
						iterating, I couldn’t make that work — especially from a contrast
						and readability perspective. Once that was abandoned, the elements
						should have been shrunken a little, as they are currently slightly
						large.
					</p>
					<p>
						The navigation bar was fixed to fulfil a FreeCodeCamp requirement —
						however, it could have been made a little smaller, so it took up
						less focus and attention. New icons or small design elements may
						have helped to make it more appealing, as it currently stands out
						pleasantly.

						This was the most exciting and ambitious project by a significant
						margin and the biggest learning opportunity across all of 5
						projects. During this project, I spent a lot of time thinking about
						designing a system to be flexible, reusable and practical. Coming
						from outside the Design industry — this was a great prompt to think
						deeply about how to design-systems could be used, why they can be
						useful and start to understand some of the complexity and issues
						that need to be addressed.
					</p>
					<p>
						While the initial concept for this project was creating code
						snippets I could reuse myself in the future — I (inadvertently)
						ended up spending a lot of time thinking about functional CSS,
						design components, product consistency and design reusability.
					</p>
					<p>
						On top of that, this project was the most complex of all 5 in terms
						of navigation, information architecture, layout, hierarchy and
						usability. Each separate section had to be easy to quickly
						understand, navigate and use.

						The code block elements are sized based on the content, up until a
						certain point. At that point, they become scroll-able, with the
						content constrained within that element. This keeps things
						consistent while also resizing for the material as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						As you scroll through the page, the components navigation bar
						highlights the currently active section. Unfortunately — this
						doesn’t quite always work, but overall I’m a big fan of this effect.

						Project 5 for the FreeCodeCamp certificate is a portfolio page.

					<p>
						When navigating with the cards on the left, the content on the right
						uses ‘smooth’ scroll behaviour, a CSS property that scrolls the page
						down to the relevant section, rather than instantly moving the
						screen to the correct position.
					</p>
					<p>
						This helps the user realise this is a single page scrolling website,
						rather than multiple pages.
					</p>
					<h3 class="cs-text__article--h3">
						What I could improve next time:
					</h3>
					<p>
						The smooth scroll animation could be further enhanced by scaling the
						size of the actively viewed element. Exploring this further could
						create a more lively feel for the website. More experimentation is
						definitely needed — but this could be a way to create a more
						delightful experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						The design reuses a lot of the same components (both navigation
						components, and content components). These were all manually
						replicated — whereas much more efficient ways of generating them
						could be used. Similar to project 1, programmatically creating each
						card could improve consistency, reduce manual repetition and overall
						efficiency.

						Results and Outcomes
					</h2>
					<p>
						Every single one of these projects forced me to consider trade-offs
						and make decisions between different design patterns. Compared to
						designing these pages in Figma (my design tool of choice), these
						websites had real constraints and requirements.
					</p>
					<p>
						All 5 projects were intentionally designed with specific outcomes in
						mind — with each project to more or less success. All learning
						opportunities! One of the explicit constraints I held tightly was
						that everything had to be fully responsive, working as well on an
						iPhone 5 size screen as on a laptop or desktop. Every project met
						that goal, to different extents. And having that goal forced me to
						design and build better and better at each project.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a result, I’m confident the next project I build going forward
						will be more intentional, designed with more structure and based
						around an earlier defined design system.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall, the 5 lessons of setting projects up with strong
						foundations from the start, focusing on the final delivered design,
						organising everything for continued progression, maintaining
						consistent brand identity and using a step by step process of
						functionality first and expression afterwards will set me up for
						success in the future.
					</p>
					<p>
						The lessons from these projects will carry me forward to continue
						doing better and better design in the future.

						Next Steps
					</h2>
					<p>
						I started this project to work on visual and interaction design. My
						professional experience (link to my CV) has focused on a lot of
						user/customer/service experience design, with a lot of time spent
						using post-its and less time on visual design.
					</p>
					<p>
						This certificate gave me a great chance to keep practising my visual
						design execution and overall design craft — but it’s time to shift
						back towards solving user experience problems through the full
						product journey.
					</p>
					<p>
						My continued focus will be working through the entire product design
						process; doing discovery, research, problem definition, ideation and
						then finally solution design.
					</p>
