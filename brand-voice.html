					Introduction:
				</h2>
				<p>
					This Case Study describes how I solved a problem I was personally
					experiencing, and the steps along that path. In doing so, I’ve focused
					on my problem-solving process, rather than presenting a final,
					polished interface. That focus reflects both the context and how I
					think about design. I firmly believe that a lot of problems can be
					solved via spreadsheets and text documents — and that not everything
					needs pixel-perfect presentations (although some things do need
					that!).
				</p>

					<a href="https://twitter.com/jasontcrabtree">twitter</a> or

					hiring Product Designers, I’m actively looking for opportunities in
					Dublin, London or remote!

				<h3 class="list-paragraph cs-text__article--h3">
					Setting the Scene:
				</h3>
				<p>
					A few months ago, I applied for a job at Slack. At the time I was
					deciding between two worlds — customer operations, the field I’ve
					spent most of my career working in, and design, my future career. As
					you might be able to guess, I didn't get the job. However, now that
					I’ve committed full-time to looking for design jobs, this seems like a
					great time to talk about one of the ways I prepared for the Slack
					interview.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Spoilers:</strong> I designed a small but practical solution
					to a problem I had during the interview with Slack. That should have
					been a hint to my design ambitions!
				</p>
				<p>
					One of Slack’s strengths is its brand voice, writing and personality.
					Their voice is something they have and continue to invest a lot of
					time, effort and care into — and it's paying off. People love it!
				</p>

				</ul>

				<p>
					During the interview process I did two writing exercises, one before
					an on-site interview and one during the on-site interview. As I was
					preparing for these exercises, and knowing that writing is such an
					important focus for the Slack team, I wanted to everything I could to
					prepare. That lead to researching existing resources describing
					Slack’s voice and brainstorming ways I could take things to the next
					level. While doing that research I had the idea of reverse-engineering
					their voice using historical tweets (they've tweeted 230,000 times at
					<a href="https://twitter.com/slackhq">@SlackHQ</a>), leading to this
					case study.

					A Broad Description:
				</h3>
				<p>
					I designed a basic method of using text analysis on historic tweets to
					see common and repeated words and understand overall language choices.
				</p>
				<h3 class="list-paragraph cs-text__article--h3">
					The Specific Circumstances:
				</h3>
				<p>
					In a few sentences, I downloaded the contents of 3,200
					<a href="https://twitter.com/slackhq">@SlackHQ</a> tweets, then used
					an open source JavaScript CodePen to count how many times different
					words were repeated. Based on that output, I was able to look at
					common words and language choices. This output helped me understand
					the language used by the Slack team, thereby using it for my writing
					assignment.

					</h3>
					<ul class="ul-skills-and-services">
						<li>
							Due to my limited experience with Python and JavaScript I was

						</li>
						<li>
							Limited data analysis knowledge, reducing me to straightforward

						</li>
						<li>
							The Twitter API limits historical tweet downloads to 3,200 tweets.
						</li>
						<li>
							Existing resources on the Slack voice focus on high-level creative
							direction and how they want the customer to feel, rather than

					Research & Preparation:
				</h3>
				<p>
					Faced with this problem statement, I started by looking for existing
					resources, blog posts, talks and presentations. This lead to
					discovering a number of great resources. As I kept researching the
					subject I started to see the depth of this subject, encouraging me to
					dive in further. A few of the resources I found:

				<p>
					While these provided a foundational starting point, I still wasn’t
					sure of a few things. For example, how does Slack use the word
					‘sorry’? Is ‘sorry’ reserved for severe mistakes, or commonly used in
					polite conversation? (Answer: It's used in about 1/3rd of the tweets I
					downloaded)
				</p>
				<p>
					I then commited to the idea of downloading and analysing Slack’s
					tweets to see the exact words they used. At that point I had a second
					research path; figure out how to execute my plan.
				</p>

				<p>
					While I had a hunch my idea was possible, my own coding experience
					with HTML & CSS didn't exactly supporting downloading tweets from the
					Twitter API or running complex data analysis. Because of these
					constraints I focused on finding open source and easy to use solutions
					for the step by step functions I needed.

				<p>
					Because Slack has such a strong presence on
					<a href="https://twitter.com/slackhq">Twitter (233,000+ tweets)</a>, I
					immediately knew I wanted to use tweets as my data source. At that
					point, it was about figuring out the logistics of downloading those
					tweets. From my research, I also knew that the Slack team used a
					slightly different brand voice for tweets compared to blog posts or
					press releases. Based on the writing assignment I was given — the
					Twitter voice fit my particular use-case.
				</p>

				<p>
					I experimented with a few resources and found that a lot of existing
					tools either <strong>A)</strong> Were outside of my budget,
					<strong>B)</strong> Didn’t export a CSV/Excel readable data file, or
					<strong>C)</strong> I couldn’t get to work at all.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once I found Tweepy (<a href="http://www.tweepy.org/">
						http://www.tweepy.org/ </a
					>), the actual design execution became simple. Tweepy is a python
					script that you can run from your terminal after signing up for a
					Twitter Developer API key. Using that script, you choose which profile
					to download tweets from, then execute the script like so. Here’s me
					downloading tweets from my account!
				</p>
				<p>
					I’ve never written or used Python before — so figuring this out was a
					real highlight, showing how much you can achieve with the right google
					searches.

					The
					<a href="https://codepen.io/lalwanivikas/">Codepen Word Counter</a> I
					used required some minor tweaks. These tweaks included altering the
					‘stopWords’ section and increasing the number of top words shown from
					4 to 500. Those changes were all trial and error — fair warning!

					Breaking Down the Process:

				<p>
					This process breakdown shows that this was very much a

					goal. I think the method I used to solve my problem has a lot of merit
					as a product (maybe one day), and equally this process would be one of
					the first things I’d work on improving!

					Summarising the Results:

				<p>And finally, Voilà! We have our results.</p>
				<p>
					The results show trends, repeated words and language choices — all
					wrapped up in a helpful list ranked by word use frequency. These
					results gave clear direction for my use-case, helping me shape my
					writing based on the brand voice used by the Slack team.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the final result (a list of words based on word usage count) is
					relatively unsophisticated — it gave me what I needed to complete my
					writing assignment.

					I did later find out that the writing assignment was mostly a hygiene
					test, and as such, I probably spent FAR too much time on it. But
					that’s a story for another time.

					While this project met my particular needs, I'd be remiss without
					acknolweding that in general this was a fairly narrow scope — with
					plenty of room for improvement. Focusing on Twitter as the data source
					created restrictions and reflected a small subset of the overall brand
					voice. There is also a lot of potential improvements avaliable in
					terms of data analysis. The prevelance of S, Re, Ll and other such
					words is due to words like you're, you'll and it's — not actual words.
					Issues like these and the general focus on single words rather than
					phrases and themes are things that could be addressed and fixed using
					more sophisticated data processing techniques. Overall, I think it's
					important to acknowledge what could be improved!

					The Future of the Concept:
				</h3>
				<p>
					While this project was great for my particular use-case, and I’ve
					finished what I wanted to achieve with this concept, considering the
					idea after the fact I think it has a lot of potential depth as a real
					product. Writing, communication and a strong brand voice can be a
					massive differentiator between companies, and anything that helps
					companies, teams and individuals stand out has a lot of value.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a lot of further development possible with this base idea.
					Here are a few of those ideas. Note: these are all abstract ideas —
					not something I plan to build anytime soon!
				</p>

					<h3 class="list-paragraph cs-text__article--h3">
						What would take this to the next level?
					</h3>
					<ul class="ul-skills-and-services">
						<li>
							Wrap the core functionality inside a web app within a consolidated
							UI so that you enter the Twitter handle and immediately download
							results.
						</li>
						<li>
							Add more sophisticated data analysis options.
						</li>
						<li>
							Add support for counting emojis! 🎉😊
						</li>
						<li>
							Explore additional data sources for adding text data. It doesn't
							have to be constrainted to Twitter!
						</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="list-paragraph">
					<h3 class="list-paragraph cs-text__article--h3">
						What could turn this into a large scale product? A few ideas:
					</h3>
					<ul class="ul-skills-and-services">
						<li>
							A chrome extension similar to Grammarly that reads your writing
							and suggests words based on your companies tone of voice.
						</li>
						<li>
							A text editor that provides recommendations as you type based on
							the pre-set tone of voice guidelines.
						</li>
						<li>
							Classification for different contexts (e.g. this is the tone of
							voice for Customer Support vs Twitter vs Help Documentation.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<p>
					Design outcomes (measured against initial goals) Let’s refer back
				</p> -->

				<h3 class="list-paragraph cs-text__article--h3">Wrapping Up:</h3>
				<p>
					This project was a really great experience. It started naturally as I
					ran into the problem of needing to learn how to sound like Slack — and
					it was a great lesson in creatively solving a problem. It also helped
					me respect copywriters, product writers and writers in general even
					more. Writing effectively is such an admirable skill!
				</p>

				<p>
					One particular stand out for me is how I was able to use Python and
					JavaScript tools to help achieve a goal without knowing them with any
					depth. Googling and perseverance goes a long way!
				</p>

				<p>
					<strong>PS:</strong> I want to give a shout-out to
					<a href="https://twitter.com/annapickard">@annapickard</a>, who I
					highly recommend you follow on Twitter. Their commitment to words
					inspired me to invest the time in this — and I’d encourage you to
					check out their podcast appearances and blog posts listed throughout
					this post.
