						Summary: Design Discovery for an Online Insurance Car Repairer
						Selection Experience™️
					</h2>
					<p>
						This case study details my experiences, as part of a team,
						completing Design Discovery for a proposed new experience for
						<a href="https://www.iag.co.nz/">IAG NZ</a> car insurance customers.
						The focus of our Discovery was exploring a new way for
						<a href="https://www.state.co.nz/about">State (400,000)</a> and
						<a href="https://www.ami.co.nz/about">AMI (500,000)</a> customers to
						choose car insurance repairers during car damage claims.
					</p>
					<p>
						Guided by a 2-day, 8-person design workshop, we created a Service
						Design Blueprint Map. Ange Black and I planned, led and facilitated
						the workshop, including running senior stakeholder presentations and
						making post-workshop recommendations. Our process for this project
						was based on the Double Diamond Design Process, developed by the
						<a
							href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond"
							>British Design Council in 2005</a
						>. We focused on the initial 2 steps of
						<span class="text-span--bold">Discover</span> and
						<span class="text-span--bold">Define</span>. We started initial work
						in the <span class="text-span--bold">Develop</span> stage with plans
						to begin <span class="text-span--bold">Deliver</span> in following

						<h3 class="project-brief__sub-titles--style">The Design Problem</h3>
						<p>
							The project team was tasked with improving the process for how
							customers choose car repairers for claims lodged through an online
							claim form. Previously, IAG customers who had lodged online claims
							with IAG's main consumer brands (<a href="https://www.ami.co.nz/"
								>AMI</a
							>
							and <a href="https://www.state.co.nz/">State</a>) had to wait for
							IAG staff to call them back after they had lodged a claim.
						</p>
						<p>
							In contrast, customers who lodged claims by phone-call could
							immediately choose a repairer during the initial phone
							conversation. This led to a worse experience for online customers.
							The project team focused on design discovery for a future digital
							system that enabled customers to choose a car repairer while
							lodging claims online.
						</p>
						<p>
							<!-- This project was timed to be launched shortly after a full
						online claim lodgement re-design, wherein manual processes were
						replaced with automated processes. Our work was focused on taking
						advantage of this newly launched re-design. -->
						</p>
						<p>
							The process has wide reaching consequences, impacting all claims
							staff, all car claims and repairer partners. The initial project
							focused on defining the problem, consultation with stakeholders,
							exploring constraints and narrowing the scope to define minimal
							viable solutions. The project team achieved this goal through the
							creation of a Service Design Blueprint Map.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>

				<div class="project-brief__layout--left project-brief__layout--bottom">
					<h3 class="project-brief__sub-titles--style">Project Constraints</h3>
					<p>
						There were three main high-level constraints for the project: Scale,
						Approach, and Organisational Prioritisation. Each constraint had to
						be considered in a different way — and some of the issues the
						constraints caused were only realised midway through the project,
						causing additional issues.
					</p>
					<p>
						The most significant constraint was Scale. The Repairer Allocation
						Experience at the center of this project had the potential to impact
						hundreds of IAG staff members, 800,000+ customers, 100+ Panelbeaters
						and Car Repair Workshops, and the daily work of 50+ IAG Motor
						Assessors. As a result, extreme care and consideration was required
						at every step of the discovery process — as appropriate for an
						experience that impacts so many people.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second constraint was Approach. While this might seem an odd
						constraint, this was the first time the team had created a full
						Service Design Blueprint. We were applying a process new to IAG.
						Improvisation, creativity and trust amongst the team was required as
						we learnt and applied the new design process. Working together as a
						team, we were able to overcome these difficulties. Undoubtedly,
						future Service Design Blueprint projects will avoid this same
						complication.
					</p>
					<p>
						The final main constraint was Organisational Prioritisation. Like
						all large multi-national businesses, IAG has a never-ending number
						of priorities. This project had a limited number of staff assigned
						to complete the project, alongside their business as usual
						responsibilities. These constraints were considered and respected
						when developing solutions, plans or ideas, particularly in regards
						to software development needs — due to the particularly busy nature
						of our digital colleagues.
					</p>
					<p
						>All in all, these three constraints of problem Scale, process
						Approach and organisational Prioritisation contributed to the way we
						approached the problem, the results we achieved and the overall
						final outcomes. The project team worked through these constraints
						through teamwork, careful consideration when required, and
						creativity to overcome challenges.</p

						<p>
							The project team applied an IAG internally modified version of the
							<a
								href="https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/news-opinion/design-process-what-double-diamond"
								>Double Diamond Design Process</a
							>, with the scope of the project focused on the Define and
							Discover stages. Gathering data to better understand the
							complexities was crucial for the project, given the large number
							of stakeholders and systems involved.
						</p>

						<p>
							The project team prioritised subject matter experts from across
							the organisation, and consulted with the four distinctly different
							parts of the business. Including these experts from across IAG was
							a crucial aspect of our success.

					<p>
						The project team aimed to complete the Define and Discover steps of

					The project began with data-gathering. After the fact, it's easy to
					see how everything connects together and present the results using a
					clear narrative timeline. In reality however, life is never so tidy. A
					lot of the early focus on the project was figuring out what we knew,
					what we knew what we didn't know, and what we didn't know we didn't
					know.
				</p>
				<p class="content__paragraph--left-layout-extended">
					We overcame these challenges by talking to as many people as we could
					— and ensuring a healthy approach of re-visiting early assumptions and
					information. This was especially relevant as some early expectations,
					knowledge and assumptions were off-base, particularly our
					understanding of the process executed by the customer facing teams.
				</p>
				<p class="content__paragraph--left-layout-extended">
					After gathering all of the relevant, impactful or important data we
					could, we began to synthesis and start to understand the factors at
					play. This was achieved through the creation of a stakeholder map, a
					system map, and summarising and documenting the research sources
					utilised.

					Before our design workshop, the project team gathered customer and

					customers. This informed the service design blueprint, with plans to
					run further face-to-face customer interviews as the project progresses
					into solution design.

					The Discover step involved a wide exploration, and was followed by a
					dive deep to begin to understand the information we had gathered.
					Based on the stakeholder map, we knew there was a large number of
					different groups involved in this process — groups who had previously
					had minimal interaction with each other, which needed to be
					considered.
				</p>
				<p class="content__paragraph--left-layout-extended">
					During the Define phase, our primary goal was to understand the
					information we had gathered. In order to achieve this, the project
					team planned and facilitated a 2-day workshop. This workshop brought
					together 8 subject matter experts from the key stakeholder groups
					involved in the repairer allocation process. In this workshop we
					analysed our customer research results, identified pain and delight
					points and created the foundations of a service design blueprint. This
					work later led to the creation of our three guiding Design Principles.

					An essential step before the design workshop was identifying the happy

					After completing the service design blueprint, the project team began
					presenting the project to the wider IAG organisation. A key focus of
					this was presenting the three guiding Design Principles we had
					designed. These principles helped the project team tell a compelling

					principles also helped unify the project team towards a common
					direction and goal.
				</p>
				<p class="content__paragraph--left-layout-extended">
					Using the Design Principles, the project team then began to explore
					and develop potential solutions. These solutions were informed by the
					pain and delight points we had identified, the process mapped through
					the service design blueprint, and most importantly, the guiding Design
					Principles. The initial list of ideas and concepts was then refined
					and grouped into core ideas, ready to later be progressed and
					delivered. Refining these ideas was my final contribution to this
					project before leaving IAG in January 2019.

					<span class="image-title">Defining Guiding Design Principles</span>
					<br />
					The guiding Design Principles were created by combining everything the
					project team learnt into unified statements. During the 2-day workshop
					we identified approximately 75 pain and delight points. To create the
					design principles, the pain and delight points were grouped and
					combined into 6 high level themes, which were then combined into the
					complete 3 principles. This approach proved successful as we presented
					the principles to different stakeholder groups, each group quickly saw
					their experience and perspective had been included.

						Our goal for this project was to build an understanding of the
						repairer allocation process, and consider how that process differed
						for online vs. on the phone customers. Using that information, we
						would then build a new solution — benefiting the different
						interaction channels, IAG staff and repairers along the way. In
						seeking these goals, we needed to consider the different stakeholder
						groups involved.
					</p>
					<p>
						We achieved these goals through the creation of a Service Design
						Blueprint, which was later summarised and presented through the
						creation of three Design Principles. The project was a cross-team,
						collaborative effort, utilised customer research and pushed our
						boundaries and comfort zones.

					<br />
					<br />
					It's a mouthful of a title, but the service design map we created is
					the foundation of this entire project. With it, we took information,
					data, insights and knowledge from all over IAG and combined everything
					together in such a way that helped us understand exactly what our
					customers and staff cared about.

					<br />
					<br />
					An interesting challenge we faced was presenting our work. As shown in
					the (pixelated for confidentiality) photo, the wall was a working
					artifact. We briefly considered creating a hi-fi well designed
					version, but decided to prioritise our time in other areas.

							Stakeholder Inclusion
						</h3>
						<p
							>One of the most impactful things the project team did was
							prioritise time, energy and social capital to include different
							stakeholders groups from across IAG. This was important because in
							the past IAG has operated with different business units heavily
							siloed from one another.
						</p>

						<p>
							In addition to including different parts of IAG throughout the
							process, we also prioritised regularly presenting updates to even
							wider parts of the organisation. We held presentations at the end
							of each day of the workshop, presenting to ~30+ people. Following
							the workshop, we presented the in progress and final Service
							Design Blueprint to 4-5 smaller groups. These regular
							presentations and updates helped us keep everyone up to date,
							helped to create buy-in and take stakeholders through the project
							change journey.

					<p>
						The project delivered a number of outcomes. In keeping with the
						initial scope of the project, our work focused on internal change
						and a deep-dive discovery on the problem space, rather than
						delivering final results to customers. Overall, we delivered the
						main outcomes we set out to achieve. We also pushed the
						organisational knowledge of IAG — working in a brand-new way.
					</p>

					<h3>Key Outcomes:</h3>
					<ol class="timeline-list__list--style">
						<li>Design Principles</li>
						<li>Service Design Blueprint Map</li>
						<li>PowerPoint Pack summarising work to-date</li>
						<li>Customer Research Results</li>
						<li>Research questions to investigate next steps</li>
						<li>Organisational and Cultural Change</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Considering the outcomes we achieved, the project team created a
						strong case to advance to the next stage of product development.
						While there was definitely a messy middle to the project,
						particularly as we learnt to work in new ways, the process created
						positive outcomes, ready to advance in the next step.

							This case study describes work, completed September to December
							2018. My final contribution to this project was handing over the
							work the project team had completed to the newly hired Service
							Designer,
							<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amysekhon/"
								>Amy Sekhon Cunliffe.</a
							>
							Amy was employed to run the final stages of Develop and Deliver in
							2019. The completed work was documented in a slide deck ready for
							Amy to use as she joined the committed and determined team.
						</p>
						<p>
							The initial plans for 2019 focused on face-to-face customer
							interviews based on our initial concepts, bringing on a tech lead
							to the core project team, and working on implementing quick wins
							and small fixes balanced amongst ongoing projects.

						Project & Personal Lessons
					</h3>
					<p>
						This 3-month project was one of the most challenging, and rewarding
						periods of my career to date. As the CX Design Lead for the project
						I was directly accountable for progressing the Customer Experience
						Design aspects of the project. While I had previously participated
						in similar work, I hadn't been the nominated lead — especially on
						such a large and complex project.
					</p>

					<h3>Biggest Lessons I learnt as a CX Design Lead:</h3>
					<ol class="timeline-list__list--style">
						<li>
							Progress starts when you start, even if you don't quite know what
							you're doing, just getting started is crucial.
						</li>
						<li>
							Trust your team, and make sure you check in with each other
							frequently. Stay on the same page and clarify assumptions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Stick to convictions about uncomfortable conversations — this was
							especially relevant to how we approached customer research on this
							project, something I think I should have pushed for much more
							heavily than I did.
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>
						Overall, my biggest lesson from this project was learning that I'm
						capable of taking ownership of an ambiguous, complex problem, and
						delivering successful results. Against that, I learnt for future
						projects the importance of maintaining conviction on pushing against
						project directions I disagreee with — even when they go against the
						crowd.
					</p>

					<p>
						All in all, I'm proud to have worked alongside the great team who
						contributed to the project, and I consider it a success.

						Wrapping Up:
					</h3>
					<p>
						Hello! If you've made it this far, I admire your commitment — either
						to reading through everything, or for your skimming ability. This
						was the final project I completed at IAG over four years. It was a
						great experience that taught me a whole lot, especially about how I
						cope with pressure 😅 something we all need to learn!
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, if you enjoyed this case study so much that you'd like to read
						more from me, I'd love for you to check out my personal portfolio
						<a href="https://jasontcrabtree.com">https://jasontcrabtree.com</a>,
						or check out my blog at
						<a href="https://blog.jasontcrabtree.com"

						about Design, Strategy, Code & other things I think are rad.
